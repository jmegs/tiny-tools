# Tiny Tools

## Why

Product designers encounter little moments of friction every day – figuring out the height of that 16x9 image, remembering what "ease-in-expo" looks like, formatting text in Google Slides. Tiny Tools is my attempt to solve those little moments of friction.

## What

| Tool         | Description                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easing       | Visualize CSS easing curves and copy them to clipboard     |
| Aspect       | Calculate dimensions at different aspect ratios            |
| Letterspacer | Add space between characters with invisible unicode spaces |
